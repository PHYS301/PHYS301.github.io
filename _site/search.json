The interpretation of functions as vectors in Hilbert space provides a unifying theme for developing Fourier analysis, special functions, methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, and techniques of vector calculus. These methods are applied to selected problems in acoustics, heat flow, electromagnetic fields, and classical and quantum mechanics.\nNormally offered every year, winter\nPrerequisite(s):\n\n\n\nPHYS 211, MATH 205 can be taken concurrently.\nRecommended background, which may be taken concurrently: MATH 206."
